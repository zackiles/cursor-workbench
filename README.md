# Cursor Workbench - Rule Editor Extension

Cursor rules for teams and power users. Load, share, edit, version, and manage team and user rules across projects seamlessly without committing rules to your repo.

## 🎯 Features

- 🤝 **Rule Registry** - Synchronize team and user rules across projects using rule registries
- 💾 **Real-time Sync** - Update remote rule resgistries locally right within your editor

## 📦 Installation

## 🎮 Usage

### Adding a Registry

Create a public or private GitHub repository with a `.cursor/rules` folder that contains your rules, and add it in the Cursor Workbench Settings menu (found in the Command Palette or by clicking the gear icon in the rule editor).

### Basic Rule Editing

Rule files ending in `.mdc` will open in Cursor Workbench automatically instead of the regular Cursor editor. Rules added from a registry will shown their status in the top right of the editor if your local copy of a rule is out of date or can be synchronized with the remote registry. Remote rules can be edited individually locally and pushed to the remote registry at your own leisure by clicking the globe icon in the top right.
